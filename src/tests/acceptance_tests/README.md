# Acceptance Tests
The following markdown files show acceptance tests for each completed user story. In each acceptance test, when the step says to upload a file, you may use the files from the directory `src/tests/beautiful_uploader_test` in order to upload proper data. Note that each acceptance test starts from scratch, which is why the setup steps are shown each time. This also implies that databases are empty and the code is being run for the first time.  



### Each acceptance test has the following format:
**User story [#]**  
[Formal user story with persona]


[Brief description of user story]  
Steps to test out feature:
  1. [Step 1]
  2. [Step 2]  
  ...

[Final conclusion]
