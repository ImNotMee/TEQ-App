# BeautifulUploader Tests

Assuming you are in the [beautiful_uploader_test](.) folder, the first step is to run `test_uploading.py` either on command line with `python3 test_uploading.py` or on your editior. This will take the 8 different templates filled with sample data and insert it into the empty `client_data.db` file. Next, download an application to view the data in the database like [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/).

Navigate into the application and browse the tables.

Select the tables and view the data inserted into them based on the templates.
