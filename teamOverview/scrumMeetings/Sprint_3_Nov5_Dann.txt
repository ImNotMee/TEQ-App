What was I working on?
-Completed the TemplateHandler interface
-Completed Template Processor
-Completed Dropdown Processor

What am I working on now?
-Refactoring GUI, back button was not working, but a solution was found.
-Completing the rest of the handlers
-GUI Button Binding; instead of instantiating a command and executing it, we can
 have a method and then instantiate the command and execute it (only injecting
 a template name for instance)

Am I blocked by anything?
-Doing the handlers was tedious in nature; it is tedious to type out. A solution
 was found, and it was proposed that I take over the rest of the handlers


What are the main takeaways for me after this meeting?
-I will be probably be taking over my tasks for this upcoming sprint, I don't
 think I can take a new tasks this sprint due to the magnitude of upcoming
 work
-Will work more in sprint 5
-Happy that people took advantage of this meeting to ask questions/clarification
-Will be available for Philip to talk about design this week
-Residual: video about code review
-Residual: unit tests for templates (i.e. 90 column fields)
