What was I working on?
Task 14

What am I working on now?
Task 14

Am I blocked by anything?
My task overlapped with another and it was kind of awkward to know what we were doing
I was unable to work much on the tasks this sprint
I had midterms and other assignments to complete this week

What are the main takeaways for me after this meeting?
Many of us were unable to complete work this week due to midterms
Some tasks are unclear and overlap
