What was I working on?
Task 22 - MissingValueChecker
Task 29 - EmployeeTemplateHelper

What am I working on now?
A better way to import methods in files from different directories
Integrating MissingValueChecker into the GUI
Creating a way for users to fix their empty/incorrect fields directly in the GUI
Adding unit tests for MissingValueChecker

Am I blocked by anything?
Importing methods in files from different directories did not have an elegant solution

What are the main takeaways for me after this meeting?
Proper code review needs to be done
Need to work with Philip to create and complete a task for users to fix fields
