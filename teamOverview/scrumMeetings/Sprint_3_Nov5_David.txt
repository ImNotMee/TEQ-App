What was I working on?
- Finished emailer interface
- Began working on the actual emailer classes

What am I working on now?
- Continue working on emailers
- Possibly start on password security (hashing and inputting to database, etc)

Am I blocked by anything?
- I was blocked from some information I was unsure about, but the meeting allowed me to know what to do and cleared up some misunderstandings I had

What are the main takeaways for me after this meeting?
- We need to be able to test our user stories
- Emailer classes are more complex that I once thought, so I need to put more work into them
