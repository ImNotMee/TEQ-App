What was I working on?
-Finished base code on abstract classes; UserConsole and Console
-Finished base code for MainConsole, TEQConsole and UserConsole

What am I working on now?
-Implementing functionality to check if a value is missing (in a required field)
-Make a class for the TEQ template for missing values/duplicate values/entries; a "regex verifier"

Am I blocked by anything?
-Will inject user login into the MainConsole once completed
-As for excelParse, not too sure if I should just wrap it into a class
-Directory/variables don't conform to PEP8 for now; will advise team

What are the main takeaways for me after this meeting?
-Majority of members are blocked by midterms (I should be taking on more tasks)
-Will format sprint backlog/product backlog for this sprint
