What was I working on?
-Completed implementation of the TemplateHandler class (abstraction)
-Completed implementation of the UploadCommand class (abstraction)
-Refactored a majority of our code for PEP8 standards

What am I working on now?
-Writing the base code for the DuplicateRowRemover class
-Handling the majority of the TemplateHandlers

Am I blocked by anything?
-Will investigate further into Susan's database design; it will eventually help
 with uploading and reporting
-Refactor to fit the GUI and the terminal versions of our consoles; more
 probable to remove my terminal implementation for our main console

What are the main takeaways for me after this meeting?
-No meeting was taken place, I was personally busy.
-It is understandable that any member of the team does not make a scrum file;
 everyone was reporting that they were quite busy.
