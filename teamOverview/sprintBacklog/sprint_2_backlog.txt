User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:

1) As a TEQ employee, Mike James, I want to make only authorized agency accounts
   able to access all of the uploaded data so that we can maintain the privacy 
   of the organizations

2) As a volunteer for agency XYZ, Sam Spongy, I want to be able to upload any of
   the 8 different types of iCare excel files so that the agency that I 
   represent can contribute to the CCS program

3) As a volunteer for agency XYZ, Sam Spongy, I expect that when I upload my
   data, all entries are automatically formatted to comply with the system’s
   format so that I do not have to manually change any entries

6) As a long-term TEQ employee, Louis Chan, I want to be able to create custom
   queries by selecting from a list of variables from a drop-down bar so that I
   can customize the data I want to see
