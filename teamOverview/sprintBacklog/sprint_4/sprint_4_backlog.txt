 that there is barely any changes to story points for this sprint.
 
-Dann has found a 'better' way of dealing with the template handlers, therefore
 he has taken all tasks of the template handlers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:

1)   As a TEQ employee, Mike James, I want to make only authorized agency
     accounts able to access all of the uploaded data so that we can maintain 
     the privacy of the organizations

1a)  As a TEQ employee, Mike James, I want to email agencies their certified
     account so that they are informed that they have an account to contribute
     to the TEQ program

2)   As a volunteer for agency XYZ, Sam Spongy, I want to be able to upload any
     of the 8 different types of iCare excel files so that the agency that I
     represent can contribute to the CCS program

3)  As a volunteer for agency XYZ, Sam Spongy, I expect that when I upload my
    data, all entries are automatically formatted to comply with the systemâ€™s
    format so that I do not have to manually change any entries

10) As a TEQ employee, Mike James, I want to be able to remove agencies in the
    event that they close down so that we don't have any irrelevant data
