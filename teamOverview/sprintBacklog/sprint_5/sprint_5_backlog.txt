User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:

1)   As a TEQ employee, Mike James, I want to make only authorized agency
     accounts able to access all of the uploaded data so that we can maintain 
     the privacy of the organizations

1a)  As a TEQ employee, Mike James, I want to email agencies their certified
     account so that they are informed that they have an account to contribute
     to the TEQ program

2)   As a volunteer for agency XYZ, Sam Spongy, I want to be able to upload any
     of the 8 different types of iCare excel files so that the agency that I
     represent can contribute to the CCS program

3)  As a volunteer for agency XYZ, Sam Spongy, I expect that when I upload my
    data, all entries are automatically formatted to comply with the system's
    format so that I do not have to manually change any entries
    
4)  As a volunteer for agency XYZ, Sam Spongy, I want to be able to view any 
    data conflicts (i.e. due to duplicate fields like Child 1, Child 2, etc.) 
    or missing data when uploading, so that I can ensure that the data I 
    uploaded is accurate
    
5)  As a junior TEQ member, James Wowman, I want to simply click a button 
    (of a particular subject) to auto-generate excel files so that I do not have
    to learn the complexity of the program

7a) As a long-term TEQ employee, Louis Chan, I want to be able to see any
    predictive models that are appropriate for a specific subject
    
8)  As a TEQ employee, Mike James, I want to have the ability to run my own SQL
    queries so that I am able to manipulate the data for statistical 
    calculations
