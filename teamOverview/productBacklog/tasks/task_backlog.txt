# Task Backlog
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why Sprint 1 and 2 tasks are archived, but not placed here:

-A discussion was held on October 31st, majority of the previous tasks were 
 not found to be viable. Therefore, a majority of the tasks were not carried
 over.

-Highest possible numbered (recalled) task from previous sprints was 16, 
 so tasks will start from 17 and onward. One of the remaining tasks from the 
 previous sprint was task 10.

-Design should be uploaded to the product backlog soon.
