Using draw.io, our CRC cards diagram can be seen [here as an image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BoIwtYpYjdVMgsZa2_kcS-G6DL7L2EH7/view) (this dynamically changes, hence why this is not a static image placed here). If it is difficult to view, it can be viewed in [draw.io itself](https://www.draw.io/#G1BoIwtYpYjdVMgsZa2_kcS-G6DL7L2EH7).
